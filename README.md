# unity2D_Demo
Demo of [Unity 2D Game Kit](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/2d-game-kit-107098)

This repo is intended to provide members of CSU's Game Developers Association with a Unity project in which the Unity 2D Game Kit has been imported. The project will give members the opportunity to examine the implementation of various 2D mechanics.

### To Use This Repo
1. Create a local directory to store the repo.
2. On the home page of the repo use the "Clone or download" button to copy the link to the repo.
3. Use the terminal or git-bash to clone the repo with the command ```git clone ``` and the link you previously copied.
4. Open Unity. Choose to open a project, and navigate to the location of the cloned repo.
5. Open that project. Unity should load a relatively fresh project with the 2D Game Kit already imported.
6. Use the terminal or git-bash to create a new branch for you to work with. ```git checkout -b branchName``` where branchName is what you choose to name your branch.
7. You will now be working on your own branch, which will begin as a duplicate of master. Any changes made locally will not reflect in this repo unless you commit and push your changes.
8. Follow the provided [tutorial](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/2d-game-kit) to build your own scene. The tutorial also provides a "Game Kit Advanced Topics" section for those who want to learn more about the game kit.

This demo can serve as a reference when implementing new features into GDA projects.

### Alternate Way to Start a Project
1. Open Unity
2. Click on the "Learn" tab.
3. Under "Tutorial Projects" should be a project named "2D Game Kit". You'll have the option to either download or start the project.
4. Downloading/importing the project may take some time. After it is complete you should have the same starting state as this repo and be able to follow along with the [tutorial](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/2d-game-kit) to build your own scene.
